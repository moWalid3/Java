Linked Lists :

- The second most used data structure after arrays

- Grow and shrink automatically with out wasting memory

- Take a bit more memory -> because each node should have a reference to the next

RUNTIME COMPLEXITY :

    Lookup
            By index      O(n)
            By value      O(n)

    insert
            Beginning/End O(n)
            Middle        O(n)

    Delete
            Beginning     O(1)
            Middle        O(n)
            End           O(n)  -> in Doubly Linked List O(1)
